    <h1>Operation in \(GF(2^m)\)</h1>
    
    <p>
        \( GF(2^m) \cong \frac{GF(2)}{f(x)}\), where \(f(x)\) is an irreducible polynomial of degree \(m\) with coefficients in \(GF(2)=\{0, 1\}\).</p>
    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Definition of Irreducible Polynomial:</b>
        The first step is to define an irreducible polynomial \(f(x)\) of degree \(m\) over \(GF(2)\), the finite field of two elements (0 and 1). This irreducible polynomial is crucial for constructing the Galois field.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
        <b>Construction of the Galois Field:</b> The Galois field \(GF(2^m)\) is constructed as the quotient \(GF(2^m) \cong GF(2)[x]/f(x)\), where \(GF(2)[x]\) is the ring of polynomials with coefficients in \(GF(2)\). Each element in the Galois field is an equivalence class of polynomials modulo \(f(x)\).
    </p>
    
        
    
    <p>
        <b>Representation of Elements:</b>
        Each element in \(GF(2^m)\) can be represented by a polynomial of degree \(m-1\) or less, where the coefficients are 0 or 1.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
        <b>Operations in the Galois Field:</b>
        Addition and multiplication operations in \(GF(2^m)\) are performed using operations modulo \(f(x)\). These operations follow specific rules, and due to the choice of an irreducible polynomial, the results always remain within the finite field.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
        <b>Generation of Elements:</b>
        Elements of \(GF(2^m)\) can be generated by considering all possible polynomials of degree \(m-1\) or less with coefficients in \(\mathbb{F}_2\). However, only some of these polynomials are non-zero elements of the field, and those divisible by \(f(x)\) are excluded.
    </p>
        
    
    <p>
        <b>Number of Elements:</b>
        The number of elements in \(GF(2^m)\) is \(2^m\), as each coefficient of a polynomial can be 0 or 1, and there are \(m\) coefficients in total.
    </p>

    <h2>Calculation of operations in \( GF(2^{13}) \cong \frac{GF(2)}{x^{13}+x^4+x^3+x+1}\)</h2>
    <p>Next we perform addition, multiplication and division operations in \( GF(2^{13}) \cong \frac{GF(2)}{x^{13}+x^4+x^3+x+1}\). These operations, called from Python, are optimized and written in C code.</p>
