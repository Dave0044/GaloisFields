    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Galois Fields:</b></p>
    <p>Galois Fields are important algebraic structures in number theory and abstract algebra. They are related to field theory and find applications in cryptography and error-correction codes.</p>

    <p>A Galois Field is a special type of finite field, where the number of elements in the field is a power of a prime number. Galois theory provides tools for studying the roots of polynomials and solving algebraic equations.</p>

    <p>Galois Fields are fundamental in constructing field extensions and in solving classically unsolvable problems by radicals. Galois theory was developed by Ã‰variste Galois in the 19th century and has had a significant impact on various areas of mathematics.</p>

    <p>Exploring Galois Fields involves understanding their properties, extensions, and applications in different mathematical and computational contexts.</p>
